`BIOGRAPHY`

I'm a student at Elgin Community College in Elgin, Illinois.

I've been programming since 2020 as a hobby. I started with Discord Bots and moved up to Game Mods. I've made a Game Mod that was a server plugin that had over a thousand players lifetime. I've made projects in Python, Java, C#, and some of my school work was in C++. 

I'd say I'm a hardcore gamer, but I don't play games, I mostly modify them. 

When VS Code isn't on my taskbar, I'm usually doing photography, working my part-time job, or exploring with friends.
