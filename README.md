`BIOGRAPHY`

I'm a student at Elgin Community College in Elgin, Illinois.

I've been programming since 2020, as a hobby. I started with Discord Bots and moved up to Game Mods. I've made a Game Mod that was a server plugin that had over a thousand players lifetime. I've created projects in Python, Java, C#, and some of my school work was in C++. 


`SUMMER 2025 CONTRIBUTIONS`

My contributions for summer 2025 are all from my private Counter-Strike 2 server plugins. I might publish some code snippets.
